# Iodine

A Forge mod - Bukkit plugin pair that lets plugins show real user interfaces to players.
This is a successor to [NickAc's Lithium project](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/lithium.277556/).

## Modules

This project consists of multiple subprojects, each with their own roles:

 - **iodine-common:** contains code that both *iodine-bukkit* and *iodine-forge* requires
 - **iodine-bukkit:** the Bukkit plugin part of the project
 - **iodine-api:** the API that plugin developers use, included in *iodine-bukkit*
 - **iodine-forge:** the Forge mod part of the project
